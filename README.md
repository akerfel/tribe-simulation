# tribe-simulation

A large scale simulation of tribes which fight each other for survival. Each colored pixel represents a living entity. Pixels with the same color are in the same tribe, and will thus help each other survive.

During each simulation tick, various events can occur. For instance, entities may give birth to new entities, entities can perish, new tribes can form, and viruses can emerge and spread, leading to the demise of entities. Real-time adjustments to the probabilities of these events can be made using the controls located in the upper left corner.
